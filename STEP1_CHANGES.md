# Step 1: Enhanced Admin System Foundation

## Summary
This PR enhances the admin system foundation with improved models, email service, and configuration for the upcoming super admin functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Admin Model (`moohaar-backend/src/models/admin.model.js`)
- ✅ Added `name` field for admin identification
- ✅ Enhanced role system: `superadmin`, `admin`, `manager`, `editor`
- ✅ Added granular permissions system:
  - `themeManagement` - Upload, edit, delete themes
  - `addonManagement` - Manage plugins/addons
  - `userManagement` - Create/edit merchants
  - `storeManagement` - View/edit stores
  - `analyticsAccess` - View platform metrics
  - `systemSettings` - Platform configuration
- ✅ Added invitation system with tokens and expiry
- ✅ Added unique URL generation for admin access
- ✅ Added activity tracking (last login, creation tracking)
- ✅ Added database indexes for performance

### 2. Email Service (`moohaar-backend/src/services/email.service.js`)
- ✅ Created professional email service with nodemailer
- ✅ Added branded admin invitation email templates
- ✅ Error handling and logging for email delivery
- ✅ Configurable email settings

### 3. Configuration Updates (`moohaar-backend/src/config/index.js`)
- ✅ Added email configuration (RESET_EMAIL, RESET_PASS)
- ✅ Added frontend URL configuration for email links

### 4. Dependencies (`moohaar-backend/package.json`)
- ✅ Added nodemailer@^6.10.1 for email functionality

## Database Migration
The enhanced admin model is backward compatible. Existing admin records will work with default values for new fields.

## Security Features
- Rate limiting preparation for super admin registration
- Secure invitation token system
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Activity tracking for audit trails

## Next Steps (Step 2)
- Super admin authentication controllers
- Enhanced middleware with permission checking
- API routes for admin management

## Testing
- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing admin functionality
- Email service gracefully handles missing configuration
